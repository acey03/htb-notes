## The most important and most difficult thing in any situation is not the search for the right answer but the search for the right question.

Write down any questions you have, any of them. whenever u think of a question, then verify if its a good question. This will develop the skills to recognize and come up with better questions.

1. How can I manage my time better? (rough)
2. What things should I focus on learning first? (rough)
3. Why am I not applying for coops? (rough)
4. How can I split my time up on Tuesday and Thursday to get enough time to study for macm? (precise)

### There are no 'good' or 'bad' questions.
- only rough and precise

Why we ask questions:
- To understand the reason for an event (past)
- To experience something completely new and to understand the way something works (present)
- To predict the effect of an event (future)

# Relationship Oriented Questioning Model

- We need to find out the core element of the question and insert it as the object.
- We must have at least two components defined in the model. More than two components are optional.
- We already have 1 component (our position and view on the object in the question)

### A right question is a precise question that allows us to establish the relationships between the components, to understand them, and to take us one step further to the required answer.
